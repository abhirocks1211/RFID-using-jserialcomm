# RFID-using-jserialcomm
Employee logger with RFID and database using jserialcomm java library

Use the EXAMPLE.sql to import the example database.
Make sure to load any jars and dlls during runtime in the code if needed.

I used the jserialcomm library from here- http://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/
Checkout their examples for hints.

Arduino codes are included as zip.
Treat 'vubo' folder as a library and include when compiling Arduino codes.
How to add 'vubo' it as library? Check this short video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-kWY6eSa64&feature=youtu.be&t=89

If u stumble upon any bugs, plz let me know. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible. Any suggestion is appreciated.
