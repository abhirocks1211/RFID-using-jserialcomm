# RFID-using-jserialcomm
Arduino employee logger with MFRC522 RFID module and database using jserialcomm java library

***Use the EXAMPLE.sql to import the example database.

Make sure to load any jars and dlls during runtime in the code if needed.
I used the jserialcomm library from here- http://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/
Checkout their examples for hints.

***The app needs to be able to access the 'uploads' folder for images and other resources.

***Arduino codes are included as zip.
Treat 'vubo' folder as a library and include when compiling Arduino codes.
How to add 'vubo' as library? Check this short video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-kWY6eSa64&feature=youtu.be&t=89

***Check 'rfid_sch.PNG' for connecting rfid module to arduino board.

If u stumble upon any bugs, plz let me know. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible. Any suggestion is appreciated.
